# Replicator
proof of concept for a star trek replicator, other tests need to be performed. In order to use this, a printer capable of running moonraker and capable of using wifi/lan. The first step to use this is to root your 3D printer and install moonraker. Several guides exist, and I wont discuss them here as it depends on the model of printer you have. Second step is to set up an ngrok account. Thirdly, you'll need to install shap-e into this directory as well as install the requirements.txt files. Lastly you'll want to configure your code so that all the relavent details are there such as your 3d printer ip and config settings.


BUGS THAT I EXPERIENCED THAT MIGHT HELP (W HARDWARE):
filament kept breaking in extruder - make sure config is ok
printer cant find wifi - wait it out and see if it shows up on LAN anyways
