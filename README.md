# fabricator
proof of concept for a star trek fabricator, other tests need to be performed. Must run octoprint on a raspberry pi on your local network. Must have an openai api key. Must modify the pip library octorest to not validate an ssl. Can speak things into existence. Make sure octoprint and the pi have curaslicer settings.
