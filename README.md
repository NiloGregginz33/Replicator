# fabricator
proof of concept for a star trek fabricator, other tests need to be performed. Must run octoprint on a raspberry pi on your local network. Must have an openai api key. Must modify the pip library octorest to not validate an ssl. Can speak things into existence. Will add a model scraper and stuff like that as I go on.
