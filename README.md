# fabricator
proof of concept for a star trek fabricator, other tests need to be performed. Can print any item you say but try to be specific. Must run octoprint on a raspberry pi on your local network. Must have an openai api key. Must modify the pip library octorest to not validate an ssl. Also say something like "hey jarvis, make a chicken" or something similar because it is grammar sensitive. Can speak things into existence. Make sure octoprint and the pi have curaslicer settings. Next step is to make it so i can talk anywhwere
